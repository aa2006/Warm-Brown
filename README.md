## Firefox Add-on

To use the generated extension package, the code will need to be packaged up and signed by Mozilla.

To package the code in preparation for submission, the `web-ext` tool can be used:

    npx web-ext build --source-dir 'Firefox Add-on/Themer Dark'

Then the package can be submitted to Mozilla for review in the [Add-on Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/distribution).

Learn more about Firefox themes from [extensionworkshop.com](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/)

To theme Firefox without the need to create a developer account and go through the extension review process, see themer's integration with [Firefox Color](https://color.firefox.com).

## Firefox Color

The Firefox Color add-on allows for simple theming without the need for a developer account or package review process by Mozilla.

1. Install the [Firefox Color add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/).
2. Open 'Firefox Color/themer-dark.url' directly with Firefox.
3. Click "Yep" when prompted to apply the custom theme.

For a more fully featured Firefox theme, see themer's Firefox theme add-on generator.
